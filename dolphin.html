    Dolphins belong in the class of marine mammals and mainly reside in the world's 
    oceans, seas and rivers. Since dolphins are mammals, they need to visit the surface
    in order to breathe air as they can not extract oxygen from the water. The dolphins 
    diet consits of fish, crustaceans, and squid that they do not chew and swallow 
    instead. Dolphins are also classified as a highly intelligent animals with their 
    display of strong communication, perception and problem-solving. They can make different
    noises in order to communicate and socialize with other dolphins, this includes whistles,
