      The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
      It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white 
      underside. An apex predator,it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild 
      boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring 
      large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and 
      rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then 
      become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
