    Monkeys are a large and diverse mammal group that includes most primates. Humans, 
    chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other apes share an ancestor with monkeys but belong 
    to a separate group of primates that diverged from monkeys millions of years ago. 
    Monkeys are typically smaller than apes and usually have tails, which apes lack. The monkey 
    group doesn't include lemurs, which are another branch of the primate family tree and 
    live in Madagascar.
