      The koala belongs in the class of marsupials and mainly reside in either 
      southeastern or eastern sides of Australia, specifically in New South Wales, 
      Queensland, and Victoria. They have poor vision but strong hearing and strong 
      smelliing abilities aids koalas in being able to protect themselves and find 
      food. Koala's diet mainly consists of eucalypt leaves which provides them food 
      and water, allowing them to stay on trees without having to climb down for long 
      periods of time. The koala species have been endangered for the last decade due 
      to constant deforestation, which destroyed a majority of the koalas homes and 
      disease, which affected their life expectancy.
