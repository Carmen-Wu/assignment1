    Hippos have unique skin that needs to be kept wet for a good part of the day. 
    Staying out of the water for too long can lead to dehydration, so hippos try to 
    remain in water during the day. They donâ€™t have true sweat glands; instead, hippos 
    secrete a thick, red substance from their pores known as "blood sweat," as it looks 
    like they are sweating blood. But not to worry! The blood sweat creates a layer of 
    mucous that protects hippo skin from sunburn and keeps it moist. It is thought that 
    this mucous may also prevent infections; even large wounds don't seem to get infected 
    despite the filthy water hippos sometimes live in in their native habitat.
