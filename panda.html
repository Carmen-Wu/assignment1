    The panda bear, also known as the giant panda, resides in China and 
    can be distinguished by their unique black and white coat. The diet of 
    the panda bear consits mainly of vegetables and bamboo shoots, which makes
    up more than 99% of its diet. Even though most of their diet is vegetarian,
    they still eat non-vegetarian foods like eggs, pumpkin, and small animals.
    They spend most of their day, anywhere from 10 to 16 hours a day eating bamboo 
    and they need at least two different bamboo species in their diet to stay 
    healthy.
